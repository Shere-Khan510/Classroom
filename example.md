# Session 2: Core Engine Mechanical Testing
## Lecture Slides & Teaching Notes
**Duration:** Approximately 75 minutes  
**ASE A1 Tasks Covered:** A.7, A.9, A.10

---

## Slide 1: Title Slide
### Core Engine Mechanical Testing
**Session 2 - ASE A1 Engine Repair**
- Vacuum Testing (Task A.7)
- Compression Testing (Task A.9)
- Leak-Down Testing (Task A.10)

**Teaching Notes:** Welcome students. Emphasize that this session is arguably the most important of the entire course. A disciplined and systematic approach to these tests saves enormous time and prevents misdiagnosis.

---

## Slide 2: Learning Objectives
### By the end of this session, you will be able to:
- Perform and interpret manifold vacuum tests
- Execute both dry and wet compression tests
- Conduct cylinder leak-down tests
- Diagnose engine mechanical problems using test results
- Understand the relationship between test results and specific engine problems

**Teaching Notes:** These three tests form the foundation of engine mechanical diagnosis. They tell us if we have an engine problem before we start replacing parts.

---

## Slide 3: The Engine as an Air Pump
### Fundamental Concept
- **Primary Function:** An engine is essentially an air pump
- **Two Critical Requirements:**
  1. Ability to pull air in and push it out (breathing)
  2. Ability to seal cylinders to compress air
- **Volumetric Efficiency (VE):** Measure of how effectively an engine fills its cylinders compared to theoretical capacity

**Teaching Notes:** If students understand this concept, everything else makes sense. A healthy engine is an efficient air pump.

---

## Slide 4: Overview of Three Core Tests
### Diagnostic Progression
1. **Vacuum Test** - Overall engine breathing (quick health check)
2. **Compression Test** - Cylinder sealing ability (identifies weak cylinders)
3. **Leak-Down Test** - Where compression is escaping (pinpoints the problem)

**Teaching Notes:** These tests build on each other. Start broad (vacuum), narrow down (compression), then pinpoint (leak-down).

---

## PART 1: MANIFOLD VACUUM TESTING (Task A.7)

## Slide 5: What is Manifold Vacuum?
### Understanding Vacuum Formation
- **Definition:** Low-pressure area created in intake manifold when pistons descend with throttle closed
- **Measurement:** Inches of mercury (in. Hg)
- **Creation:** Piston downstroke + closed throttle = vacuum
- **Significance:** Indicates overall mechanical condition

**Teaching Notes:** 1 inch of mercury â‰ˆ 0.491 psi. Vacuum is actually a misnomer - we're measuring pressure differential.

---

## Slide 6: Vacuum Gauge Setup
### Connection Procedure
1. Locate vacuum port on intake manifold (PAST throttle body)
2. May need T-fitting for existing vacuum line
3. Engine at operating temperature
4. All accessories off
5. Transmission in neutral/park

**Teaching Notes:** Emphasize: Must connect to manifold vacuum, NOT ported vacuum. Show physical examples if available.

---

## Slide 7: Normal Vacuum Readings
### Baseline Values at Sea Level
- **Normal idle:** 17-22 in. Hg (steady needle)
- **Altitude adjustment:** -1 in. Hg per 1,000 ft elevation
- **Quick snap test:** 
  - Drops to 0-3 in. Hg
  - Jumps to 25 in. Hg
  - Returns to 17-22 in. Hg

**Teaching Notes:** Local altitude: Adjust expectations accordingly. Lawrence, KS is approximately 850 ft - expect readings about 1 in. Hg lower than sea level.

---

## Slide 8: Abnormal Vacuum Readings - Part 1
### Low Steady Vacuum
| Reading | Likely Cause |
|---------|--------------|
| 5-10 in. Hg | Major intake leak (loud hissing) |
| 10-15 in. Hg | Late valve timing (jumped timing) |
| 15-18 in. Hg | Retarded ignition timing |

**Teaching Notes:** Low steady readings affect all cylinders equally - think "breathing" problems.

---

## Slide 9: Abnormal Vacuum Readings - Part 2
### Fluctuating Vacuum
| Needle Behavior | Likely Cause |
|-----------------|--------------|
| Regular drop of 3-5 in. Hg | Sticky valve |
| Regular drop of 6+ in. Hg | Burned valve |
| Rapid vibration 14-20 in. Hg | Worn valve guides |
| Erratic swings | Head gasket between cylinders |

**Teaching Notes:** Fluctuating readings indicate problems in specific cylinders, not all cylinders.

---

## Slide 10: Vacuum Test During Acceleration
### Dynamic Testing
- **Normal:** Vacuum drops during acceleration, recovers quickly when throttle released
- **Restricted exhaust:** 
  - Starts normal at idle
  - Gradually drops as RPM increases
  - Slow recovery
- **Weak valve springs:** Needle flutter increases with RPM

**Teaching Notes:** Dynamic tests reveal problems that don't show at idle. Always perform both static and dynamic tests.

---

## PART 2: COMPRESSION TESTING (Task A.9)

## Slide 11: Compression Test Fundamentals
### Why Test Compression?
- **Purpose:** Measure cylinder's ability to build pressure
- **What it tells us:** 
  - Overall cylinder health
  - Identifies weak cylinders
  - Compares cylinder uniformity
- **Limitation:** Doesn't tell us WHY compression is low

**Teaching Notes:** Compression test is like taking blood pressure - tells us if there's a problem, not what the problem is.

---

## Slide 12: Compression Test Preparation
### Critical Setup Steps
1. **Engine at operating temperature** (pistons/rings expanded)
2. **Battery fully charged** (consistent cranking speed)
3. **All spark plugs removed** (reduces resistance)
4. **Throttle wide open** (maximum airflow)
5. **Ignition disabled** (safety)
6. **Fuel disabled** (prevent flooding)

**Teaching Notes:** Each step is critical. Skipping any step gives false readings. Cold engine = 10-15 PSI lower readings.

---

## Slide 13: Dry Compression Test Procedure
### Step-by-Step Process
1. Thread compression gauge into spark plug hole
2. Have assistant crank engine 6-8 compression strokes
3. Note pressure build pattern:
   - 1st stroke: ~40 PSI
   - Each additional: +35 PSI
   - Should reach maximum by 4th stroke
4. Record highest reading
5. Test all cylinders same way

**Teaching Notes:** Listen to cranking speed - it slows when tested cylinder comes up on compression stroke.

---

## Slide 14: Interpreting Dry Compression Results
### Reading Analysis
- **Excellent:** 135+ PSI
- **Good:** 100-135 PSI
- **Poor:** Below 85 PSI
- **Critical rule:** No more than 20% variation between cylinders
- **Minimum acceptable:** 100 PSI on lowest cylinder

**Example:** 150, 145, 148, 120 = Problem with cylinder 4

**Teaching Notes:** Consistency is more important than absolute numbers. A 120 PSI engine running on all cylinders runs better than 150 PSI with one at 100.

---

## Slide 15: Wet Compression Test
### Isolating Ring Problems
**Procedure:**
1. Add 1 tablespoon engine oil to low cylinder
2. Crank engine 2 revolutions to spread oil
3. Retest compression

**Results Interpretation:**
- **Increases 40+ PSI:** Ring/cylinder wall problem
- **Increases <5 PSI:** Valve or head gasket problem
- **Adjacent cylinders both low (no change wet):** Head gasket between cylinders

**Teaching Notes:** Oil temporarily seals worn rings but won't help valve problems. This is detective work!

---

## Slide 16: Compression Test Patterns
### Diagnostic Clues
| Pattern | Diagnosis |
|---------|-----------|
| All cylinders equally low | Timing chain/belt jumped |
| One cylinder low | Burned valve, broken ring |
| Two adjacent low | Head gasket failure |
| Slow pressure build | Worn rings |
| No pressure build | Hole in piston, valve stuck open |

**Teaching Notes:** Pattern recognition is key. Experience comes from testing many engines.

---

## PART 3: CYLINDER LEAK-DOWN TESTING (Task A.10)

## Slide 17: Leak-Down Test Overview
### Advanced Diagnostics
- **Concept:** Apply regulated air pressure, measure what escapes
- **Advantage:** Shows WHERE compression is leaking
- **Requirements:** 
  - Compressed air source (100 PSI)
  - Leak-down tester
  - Engine at TDC compression stroke

**Teaching Notes:** This is our most precise test - like using a stethoscope vs. just taking a pulse.

---

## Slide 18: Setting Up for Leak-Down Test
### Critical Positioning
1. **Remove spark plug** from test cylinder
2. **Find TDC compression stroke:**
   - Both valves closed
   - Piston at highest point
3. **Install leak-down tester**
4. **Apply parking brake** (air pressure can turn engine)
5. **Leave other plugs in** (provides resistance)

**Teaching Notes:** TDC is critical - if valves are open, you get false readings. Use a long screwdriver to feel piston position.

---

## Slide 19: Performing the Leak-Down Test
### Test Procedure
1. **Set regulator:** 100 PSI input pressure
2. **Connect to cylinder**
3. **Read percentage loss**
4. **Listen for air escaping:**
   - Intake (throttle body) = Intake valve
   - Exhaust (tailpipe) = Exhaust valve
   - Oil filler cap = Rings
   - Coolant (bubbles) = Head gasket
5. **Rock engine slightly** at TDC to seat rings

**Teaching Notes:** The "where" is as important as "how much." Location tells us exactly what's wrong.

---

## Slide 20: Interpreting Leak-Down Results
### Leakage Percentages
| Leakage % | Condition | Action |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| 0-5% | Excellent | None needed |
| 5-10% | Good | Monitor |
| 10-15% | Acceptable | Plan future work |
| 15-20% | Marginal | Repairs soon |
| 20-30% | Poor | Immediate repair |
| >30% | Failed | Major overhaul |

**Teaching Notes:** Consistency between cylinders matters. 15% on all cylinders is better than 5% on three and 25% on one.

---

## Slide 21: Leak-Down Diagnostic Locations
### Where to Listen
**Intake Valve Leak:**
- Air at throttle body
- Often carbon buildup
- May improve after tapping valve

**Exhaust Valve Leak:**
- Air at tailpipe
- Usually burned valve
- Won't improve with tapping

**Ring Leak:**
- Air at oil cap/PCV
- Normal wear pattern
- Increases with mileage

**Head Gasket:**
- Bubbles in radiator
- Adjacent cylinders affected
- Often overheating history

**Teaching Notes:** Demonstrate listening techniques. Use mechanic's stethoscope if available.

---

## Slide 22: Comparing All Three Tests
### Diagnostic Strategy
| Test | Speed | Information | Best For |
|------|-------|-------------|----------|
| Vacuum | Fast (2 min) | Overall health | Initial assessment |
| Compression | Medium (15 min) | Cylinder comparison | Finding bad cylinder |
| Leak-Down | Slow (30 min) | Exact problem | Pinpointing failure |

**Teaching Notes:** Use tests in sequence. Each test costs time - only do what's necessary to diagnose.

---

## Slide 23: Real-World Scenario #1
### Case Study: Rough Idle
**Symptoms:** Rough idle, occasional misfire
1. **Vacuum test:** Needle drops 4 in. Hg regularly
2. **Compression test:** Cyl #3 reads 90 PSI, others 140 PSI
3. **Wet test on #3:** Still 92 PSI
4. **Leak-down #3:** 35% leakage at exhaust

**Diagnosis:** Burned exhaust valve cylinder #3

**Teaching Notes:** Walk through logical progression. This saves time vs. randomly replacing parts.

---

## Slide 24: Real-World Scenario #2
### Case Study: Blue Smoke
**Symptoms:** Blue smoke on startup, oil consumption
1. **Vacuum test:** Slightly low at 15 in. Hg, steady
2. **Compression test:** All cylinders 110-120 PSI
3. **Wet test:** All increase to 150-160 PSI
4. **Leak-down:** 18-22% leakage at oil cap, all cylinders

**Diagnosis:** Worn piston rings all cylinders

**Teaching Notes:** Pattern shows general wear, not single cylinder failure. Time for rebuild.

---

## Slide 25: Common Testing Mistakes
### Pitfalls to Avoid
1. **Testing cold engine** (false low readings)
2. **Weak battery** (inconsistent cranking)
3. **Throttle not open** (restricted airflow)
4. **Wrong TDC** (exhaust vs. compression)
5. **Dirty spark plug threads** (leakage past tester)
6. **Not comparing all cylinders** (missing patterns)
7. **Rushing tests** (missing subtle clues)

**Teaching Notes:** These mistakes lead to misdiagnosis and wasted money. Take time to do it right.

---

## Slide 26: Special Considerations
### Modern Engine Variables
- **High-performance cams:** Lower vacuum normal (14-16 in. Hg)
- **Turbo/Supercharged:** Different compression ratios
- **Variable valve timing:** May affect readings
- **Direct injection:** Carbon buildup common on intake valves
- **Start-stop systems:** May show unusual wear patterns

**Teaching Notes:** Always consult service information for specific engine specifications.

---

## Slide 27: Test Equipment Care
### Tool Maintenance
**Vacuum Gauge:**
- Check zero before use
- Protect from impact
- Clean connections

**Compression Tester:**
- Clean threads after use
- Check Schrader valve
- Verify gauge accuracy

**Leak-Down Tester:**
- Calibrate regularly
- Clean air supply
- Check hose connections

**Teaching Notes:** Good tools give good results. Invest in quality, maintain properly.

---

## Slide 28: Documentation
### Recording Results
**Create Test Sheet Including:**
- Date/mileage
- Engine temperature
- Test conditions
- Cylinder numbers
- All readings
- Notes on sounds/observations
- Recommended actions

**Teaching Notes:** Professional documentation supports warranty claims and shows customer value.

---

## Slide 29: Safety Reminders
### Critical Safety Points
- **Hot engine** = Burns (wear gloves)
- **Compressed air** = Eye injury (wear safety glasses)
- **Rotating engine** = Caught clothing (remove jewelry)
- **Fuel vapors** = Fire hazard (disable fuel system)
- **High pressure** = Part ejection (secure connections)
- **Battery sparks** = Explosion (proper connections)

**Teaching Notes:** One injury negates all profit from the job. Safety first, always.

---

## Slide 30: Summary & Key Takeaways
### Remember These Points
1. **These three tests can diagnose 90% of engine mechanical problems**
2. **Use tests in sequence: Vacuum â†’ Compression â†’ Leak-Down**
3. **Pattern recognition is key to diagnosis**
4. **Proper setup ensures accurate results**
5. **WHERE air leaks tells you WHAT'S wrong**
6. **Documentation proves professionalism**
7. **These tests SAVE time and money vs. guessing**

**Teaching Notes:** Master these three tests and you'll rarely misdiagnose an engine problem. This knowledge separates professionals from parts changers.

---

## Slide 31: Questions & Discussion
### Review Questions for Students:
1. What vacuum reading indicates retarded ignition timing?
2. How much oil for a wet compression test?
3. What does 30% leak-down with air at the oil cap indicate?
4. Why must engine be warm for compression testing?
5. What pattern suggests a blown head gasket?

**Teaching Notes:** Use remaining time for Q&A. Ensure everyone understands before moving to lab. These concepts MUST be solid before hands-on work.
